#   Description: Smarter tab-completion
# ----------------------------------------

## Perform file completion in a case insensitive fashion
set completion-ignore-case on

## Treat hyphens and underscores as equivalents
set completion-map-case on

## If there are more than 200 possible completions for a word, ask to show them all
set completion-query-items 200

## Immediately add a trailing slash when autocompleting symlinks to directories
set mark-symlinked-directories on

## Do not autocomplete hidden files unless the pattern explicitly begins with a dot
set match-hidden-files off

## Show all autocomplete results at once
set page-completions off

## Display matches for ambiguous patterns at first tab press
set show-all-if-ambiguous on

## Show extra file information when completing, like `ls -F` does
set visible-stats on

## Allow UTF-8 input and output, instead of showing stuff like $'\0123\0456'
set convert-meta off
set input-meta on
set output-meta on

## Use the text that has already been typed as the prefix for searching through commands
"\e[A": history-search-backward
"\e[B": history-search-forward

## Use Alt/Meta + Delete to delete the preceding word
"\e[3;3~": kill-word
